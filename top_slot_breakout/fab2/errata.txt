1. OLED pinout needs option of supply being reversed. Most are VCC GND
not GND VCC
2. Re-aarange TWI and SD signals so HW works wih code.
   SD MISO DO = 16
   SD MOSI DI = 19
   SD SCK     = 18
   SD SS      = 22
   
   TWI    SDA  = 28
   TWI    SCLK = 17
   
   This works on first V1.0 (green) PCB after re-wriring.
   
   Blue (V1.1) PCB works with wiring, SD and display after mods done.
   
3. Level shifters do not work, Use 74LVC245 shiftr ICs
4. Add a SWD connector for programming
5. One bidirectional and Pico switched, the other always Organiser -> Pico
6. Add jumpers to re-arrange the OLED supply pins (SDA and SCLK too?)
